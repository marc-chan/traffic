## Vehicle Detection with CNNs

These presentation slides and notebook are meant to give a basic overview of basic techniques in computer vision, relating to classification, localization and detection.

Pretrained weight files for the detection notebook are too big to be hosted on Github. Find the numpy array weight file [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5pR4zogx2nBS3FLUFhBTENEQXM) and the h5 format weight file [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5pR4zogx2nBYUpVT25TN1A4Z0E).

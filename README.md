## Vehicle Detection with CNNs

These presentation slides and notebook are meant to give a basic overview of basic techniques in computer vision, relating to classification, localization and detection.

### Classfication and Localization (Part 1)

Part 1 covers how to setup and train a CNN (LeNet architecture) using Tensorflow core.

### Detection (Part 2)

Part 2 covers how to use a pretrained network (tiny YOLO v1) to perform inference in Keras 2.

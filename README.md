## Traffic image detection

Traffic congestion is an expensive byproduct of urban growth, costing society billions of dollars a year in lost productivity and environmental pollution.

Better traffic management from coordinated traffic lights and speed limits is a good solution, but requires real-time traffic information at multiple intersections, junctions and roads.

The Singapore government has released real-time traffic camera images, made available as an API. With computer vision techniques, congestion can be detected as it develops, and adjustments to the traffic system can be made.
